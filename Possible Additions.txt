1. Algorithm Selection: Allow users to select from different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort) to visualize. This demonstrates your understanding of different sorting algorithms and their implementations.

2. Customizable Input: Provide options for users to input their own arrays or generate random arrays of varying sizes. This showcases your ability to handle user input and dynamically adjust the visualization accordingly.

3. Step-by-Step Navigation: Implement controls (such as buttons or sliders) that allow users to navigate through the sorting process step by step. This helps users understand the algorithm's inner workings and demonstrates your attention to detail in the visualization.

4. Color Customization: Allow users to customize the colors used in the visualization. This adds a personal touch to the program and showcases your design skills.

5. Performance Metrics: Display performance metrics such as time complexity or number of comparisons/swaps during the sorting process. This demonstrates your understanding of algorithmic analysis and performance optimization.

6. Multiple Views: Provide multiple views of the sorting process, such as a bar graph view and a table view. This showcases your ability to create versatile and informative visualizations.

7. Real-Time Sorting: Implement real-time sorting where the visualization updates as the sorting algorithm progresses. This adds interactivity to the program and demonstrates your proficiency in handling dynamic data updates.

8. Documentation and Comments: Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining the logic behind each component and feature. This showcases your communication skills and makes it easier for others to understand and extend your code.

9. Responsive Design: Ensure your visualization program is responsive and works well across different screen sizes and devices. This demonstrates your understanding of user experience (UX) design principles.

10. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle edge cases and unexpected input. This demonstrates your attention to detail and commitment to delivering a polished product.
