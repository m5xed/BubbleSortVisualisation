**A small visualisation of the bubble sort algorithm**

<p> Using Java's Swing and AWT libraries, I am developing a compact visualisation on the process of the bubble sort algoritm </p>
<p> Notorious for it's inefficency with large datasets, my model could be useful for displaying the reasons for the poor performance, helping people understand where the time complexity of O(n^2) comes from. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Version 1.0: Pure code, BubbleSort.java + VisualGUI.java </li>
    <li>Version 1.1: Comments added</li>
    <li>Version 1.2: Added labels for each bar in the GUI</li>
    <li>Version 1.3: Restructured code, Renamed file "BubbleSort.java" (from "Main.java") and started "TopMenu.java"</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Version 1.3.1 - TopMenu.Java: Added a text field for data input from the user</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
