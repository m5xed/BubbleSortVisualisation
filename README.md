**A small visualisation of the bubble sort algorithm**

<p> Using Java's Swing and AWT libraries, I am developing a compact visualisation on the process of the bubble sort algoritm </p>
<p> Notorious for it's inefficency with large datasets, my model could be useful for displaying the reasons for the poor performance, helping people understand where the time complexity of O(n^2) comes from. </p>
